Plant growth simulator 

The goal is to create a virtual environment, in which plants will learn to grow. Each plant is a manifestation of a collaboration of cells and is represented by a DNA sequence. The composition of the sequence is determined using an optimization algorithm such as a genetic algorithm, which maximizes the plant's size. A cell acts on its own. Thus, a plant is a higher abstraction concept that the cells do not know about nor care about. A cell behaves only according to its DNA, which is shared among all cells of the plant.
